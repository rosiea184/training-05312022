# javaScript Methods
## 1. Array.prototype.slice()
The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.

* slice(start)
* slice(start, end)

## 2. String.prototype.split()
The split() method divides a `String` into an ordered list of substrings, puts these substrings into an `array`, and returns the array. The division is done by searching for a pattern; where the pattern is provided as the first parameter in the method's call.

* split(separator)
* split(separator, limit)

## 3. Array.prototype.join()
The join() method creates and returns a new string by concatenating all of the elements in an array (or an array-like object), separated by commas or a specified separator string. If the array has only one item, then that item will be returned without using the separator.

* join(separator)

## 4. instanceof
The `instanceof` operator tests to see if the prototype property of a constructor appears anywhere in the prototype chain of an object. The return value is a boolean value.

* object `instanceof` constructor

## 5. typeof
The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.
